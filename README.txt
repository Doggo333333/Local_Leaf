Desc: This webapp is to help users see all the events that are happening at all parks in their city. I created this app due to a problem I faced when I was younger. Everytime I wanted to go to the basketball, the towns moms would be practicing their zoomba dancing. Now nothing agaist people exercising but they would always be doing their dance on the basketball court which meant I couldnt play there. If I had access to this webapp. Then assuming the zoomba moms created an event at the park they were practicing then I would be able to see, "oh they are praciticing today, I will save my time and not go". 

Difficulties: I faced a lot of difficulties trying to finish this app. I used the help of stackoverflow and w3 schools to help me overcome a lot of these random issues. For example, handlebars kept denying access to properties like "parkName" and "events" because they were not "own properties" of their parent objects. I don't entirely understand what the issue was but I realized I could convert it into a string and then then pass the string to avoid the restrictions. A lot of my other issues were more minor issues like file paths not working correctly, or the api not working because I set it up wrong. When I used geolocation intially I thought it would get the address, but only when I printed out the data did I realize that it was coordinants, so having to use Googles API for geocoding and reverse geocoding was a new experience since I had never used an API in JS before. (Another place where I used guidence from stack overflow.)
